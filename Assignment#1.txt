The attached dataset is about peoples' age and their blood pressure. Following is the reference of study from where the data is taken. Its a one dimensional data with first column representing age of people and the second column represent its label i.e., their blood pressure. There are a total of 30 instances.

Your task is to 
1. Define a hypothesis h(x) = theta0 + theta1.x
2. Use random function to initialize theta0 and theta1 at random
3. Calculate the cost for the given dataset
4. Repeat the process and finally submit the code with theta values that were giving the best results among all.
